# L02 - Algorithms

An algorithm is **a set of steps** to accomplish a task.

Computer algorithms must be:

* Specific
* Correct
* Reasonably efficient

## Example: *Fibonacci Numbers*

If we wish to compute the *n*'th number of the Fibonacci sequence, we do so with the following algorithm:

* F(n) = F (n-1) + F (n-2)
* Base Case: **F (1) = F(2) = 1** or **F (0) = 0**, **F(1) = 1**
